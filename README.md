Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation library
that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms.
It is the successor of
[Detectron](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron/)
and [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark/).
It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.

## What's New
* Includes new capabilities such as panoptic segmentation, Densepose, Cascade R-CNN, rotated bounding boxes, PointRend,
  DeepLab, ViTDet, MViTv2 etc.
* Used as a library to support building [research projects](projects/) on top of it.
* Models can be exported to TorchScript format or Caffe2 format for deployment.
* It [trains much faster](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/notes/benchmarks.html).

See our [blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/-detectron2-a-pytorch-based-modular-object-detection-library-/)
to see more demos and learn about detectron2.

## Installation

See [installation instructions](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/install.html).

## Getting Started

See [Getting Started with Detectron2](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/tutorials/getting_started.html),
and the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD_-m5)
to learn about basic usage.

Learn more at our [documentation](https://detectron2.readthedocs.org).
And see [projects/](projects/) for some projects that are built on top of detectron2.

## Model Zoo and Baselines

We provide a large set of baseline results and trained models available for download in the [Detectron2 Model Zoo](MODEL_ZOO.md).
